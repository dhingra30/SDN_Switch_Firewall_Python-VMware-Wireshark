# SDN_Switch_Firewall_Python-VMware-Wireshark
A switch firewall is created in a network using Software Defined Networking 

# Requirements
1. VMware with a latest version of Linux Ubuntu
2. Install the mininet packages through GitHub/packages through command line or Direct download the Ubunto image with mininet pre-installed
3. Wireshark installed on the image 
4. Understanding of the SDN controllers like ONOS or Ovrflow

# Description
SDN is used to create a virtual network in mininet. The SDN is initiated using 2 python scripts. The first network works without the controller and the second script requires the controller to initiate the SDN. Both the created networks are analysed using fireshark and other command line networking attributes to test the firewall and other security functionalities of the switch. The performance of the network is also measured. All the data is collated in the report.
